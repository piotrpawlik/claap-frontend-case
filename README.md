# Specs
1. Index page is a landing page with a single "Invite teammates" button.
2. Take as much care about UX/UI as you can. Think about disable/loading states, navigating with keyboard etc.
3. Combobox should allow to add multiple teammates
4. Combobox accepts valid emails or already defined users (Tara and Tristan)
5. No need to style what happens after clicking "Invite", just print selected users/emails.
